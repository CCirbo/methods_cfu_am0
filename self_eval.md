# Self-Evaluation

- Reflect on your learning and work today. What are you most proud of? - *It seemed like a lot of work and I stuck with it all day. I also seemed stuck or at a really had to think through some of the explanations of why the code did what it did, yet I came up with something for all questions and assignments.*
- What is the power of using methods in our applications? - *It simplifies the process and the ability to make changes without retyping everything over and over since methods are a package of instructions. Once it is defined, it can be used several times.*
